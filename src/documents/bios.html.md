				<h4>The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions</h4>

					We strive to avoid reinventing the wheel and reliving our mistakes, so we document them. The initial unMonastery prototype in Matera has provided abundant raw material. unMoaners are not at all documentation-shy: chat sessions, post-its, a web presence, project proposals and urgent emails have left behind a maze of commentary. The Book of Mistakes recycles this maze into distilled clarity. Fragments of argument and trampled shards of vision are reassembled into magnificent vessels of wisdom.

				<h4>Reference Map</h4>

					Understanding how a project gets from A-B, or to C, D, E can often be a less than obvious process, the unMonastery Roadmap is a reference map that reveals the entire path of an unMonasteryâ€™s development - ensuring that all stakeholders and participants can see the steps on the path at any stage in the journey.

				<p>
					The unMonastery is no clandestine operation, it aspires to involve as many in the process as is organisationally possible, as a result of this aspiration negotiation between individuals and groups can feel like a minefield - the Stakeholder Handbook is designed to help orientate and coach future unMonasterians in managing these relationships.
